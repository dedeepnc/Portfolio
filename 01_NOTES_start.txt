[5.1] SASS INTEGRATION

PURPOSE OF 01 FILE: STARTING FILE
  - This file picks up where we left off when we last worked with React.js in Week 3 (minor changes & NO mapping):
    -> Installed modules: react-router-dom, react-icons, bootstrap 5.1.3 & react-bootstrap
    -> App.js with react-router-dom routing setup, and routed Home page
    -> Navbar & Footer 
    -> Flexbox system built in at application/root level CSS
  
  - CleanUp & Additions
    -> BrowserRouter moved to index.js to retain improved abstraction
    -> Removed API pages (not required for static portfolio site)
    -> Uninstalled axios (same as above)
    -> Added lots of CSS to the NotFound page, to help with the upcoming SASS demonstration (updated the image, react-icon & return home link)

  - NOTE: Currently, we import our application CSS file INTO index.js BELOW the bootstrap stylesheet, so our CSS rules overwrite! (Test with the "Bootstrap Default Overwrite Tester")
